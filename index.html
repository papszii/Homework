            <span>Lorem Ipsum</span> is simply dummy text of the printing and
            typesetting industry. <span>Lorem Ipsum</span> has been the
            industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
            printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
            specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
            leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
            It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
            containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
            publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of
            <span>Lorem Ipsum</span>.

            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by
            the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point
            of using <span>Lorem Ipsum</span> is that it has a more-or-less
            normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here,
            content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop
            publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as
            their default model text, and a search for
            <span>'Lorem Ipsum'</span> will uncover many web sites still in
            their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years,
            sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the
            like)..

            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
            It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
            making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor
            at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more
            obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
            <span>Lorem Ipsum</span> passage, and going through the cites of the
            word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
            Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus
            Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
            written in 45 BC.

            There are many variations of passages of

            alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words
            which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a
            passage of <span>Lorem Ipsum</span>, you need to be sure there isn't
            anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the

            <a id="url" href="https://loremipsum.io/generator">generators</a> on
            the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making
            this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary
            of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence
            structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The
            generated <span>Lorem Ipsum</span> is therefore always free from
            repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

        "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
        pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete
        account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
        explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one
        rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,
        but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally
        encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there
        anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because
        it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil
        and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example,
        which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to
        obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with
        a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences,
        or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"

        "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike
        men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the
        moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and
        trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who
        fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying
        through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple
        and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is
        untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like
        best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in
        certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations
        of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be
        repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds
        in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to
        secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse
        pains."
